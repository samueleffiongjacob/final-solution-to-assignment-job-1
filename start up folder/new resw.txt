stard to finish step  by of handling course work.

start to finish of Analyse and visualise a dataset related to plankton in water 
where shellfish are farmed ,using a dataset which contain 
the monitoring of plankton cells pseudonitzschia
(measure in hundred of cells per litre,) alexandrim
(measured in cell per litre) and little known robgordia
(measured in cell per litre).


TASKS.

1. Use univariate statistics to analyse the plankton dataset. // do not use any plots.

2. Use a boxplot to show the distribution of Pseudonitzschia and a second one to show the distributionof water temperature.
/// coment on the plots.

3.Use Univariate statistics to compare data for Pseudonitzschia in the year 2021 with its data in previous years ( consider
all previous years together)./// comment on the results. do not use plots.

4) Produce two histograms: one showing an attribute with a skewed distribution and one showing an attribute with a normal
distribution./// comment on the plots.////difference between skewed distribution and normal distribution in R

5. Produce a bar plot for Species.comment on the plot.

6. produce a pie chart for an attribute of your choice. comment on the plot.

7. use a plot to show values of Robgordia.SP AGAINST values of Pseudonitzschia .A.SP where the species is eitHer common mussels
or pacific oysters. Use colour to show the species.comment on the plot.

8. Use a plot to show Alexandrium.Sp in different region by farming species. Use jitter if needed. comment on the plot.

9. find a pair of plankton speces which are correlated and a pair which are not correlated. Do not use plots correlated.
/// justify your answers

10. Produce a line plot Which shows the water temperature (y axis) against the sample index (x axis), for samples of common
cockles and pacific oyster. Both lines (one per species) should be shown in the same plot.

11. produce a linear regression model of Pseudonsitzshia.A.SP for a value of Robgordia.sp of 1000,2500,and 4000 cells per 
litre. justify the appropriateness of the model and comment on any concerns you may have about your predictions.
can use this model to predict the values of Rogbodia?

12. Create a dat frame with three columns: month,year,and the mean of the water temperatures observed in the plankton
dataset during that month-year period.check whether the mean temperature is 12 degrees at 99% confidence. without 
conducting another test, can you say whether the mean temperature is 12.5% at 95% confidence?

13. You suspect that the water temperature is affected by the period of the year. use plankton dataset to produce a test
to check this suspicion,clearly highlighting the Null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis and justifying whether the
suspicion is supported by the data or not. Justify your answer.f

14. NO CODE NEEDED FOR THIS TASK. YOU think that an ANOVA test may be useful to determine whether different species are 
farmed in different water temperatures. comment on any concerns that you may have if applying this test to the plankton 
dataset.

15. Using the plankton dataset( or one derived from it), select some data that has not been visualised already, and produce
TWO alternative plots of that data which you have not presented earlier. one of the plots should be very informative and 
effective while the other one should have deliberate deficiencies.compare and contrast the 2 plots, clearly highlighting
their merits and drawbacks
